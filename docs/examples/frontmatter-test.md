# Frontmatter Test

This markdown file has frontmatter at the top (between the `---` delimiters). The frontmatter should not be displayed in the preview.

## Expected Behavior

Only this content (the headings and paragraphs below the frontmatter) should be visible in the preview.

## Current Issue

Currently, the frontmatter is being displayed in the preview, which is not the desired behavior.

## Test Content

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

**Bold text** and *italic text* should render correctly.
